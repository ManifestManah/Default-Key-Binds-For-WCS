# [WC:S Reignited] Default Ultimate & Ability Keybinds

## About
This plugin makes it easier for new players to get in to Warcraft-Source and enjoy the game mode to the fullest.
The first time a new player visits your server, they will be able to use their race's ultimate and ability by pressing their use (E) and inspect (F) button respectively.
If a player doesn't want to use these keys, they can type !settings and change it to fit their personal preferences. 
If the player turns off the ability or ultimate key bind via. the settings menu, then they'll get a message explaining how they can assign the ability or ultimate to a different key.
