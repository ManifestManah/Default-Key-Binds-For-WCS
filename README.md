# Default Ultimate & Ability Key Binds For WC:S

## About
This plugin makes it easier for new players to get in to Warcraft-Source and enjoy the game mode to the fullest.
The first time a new player visits your server, they will be able to use their race's ultimate and ability by pressing their use (E) and inspect (F) button respectively.
If a player doesn't want to use these keys, they can type !settings and change it to fit their personal preferences.
